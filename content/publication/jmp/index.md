abstract: Several studies have investigated the impact of spillovers on firm productivity using total factor productivity (TFP) estimates from proxy variable/control function approaches in Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), Wooldridge (2009), De Loecker (2011), or Ackerberg et al. (2015). However, these methods implicitly rule out the interdependence of firms' outcomes and decisions. I document biases in estimates of production function elasticities and network effects when spillovers are ignored during TFP estimation. Depending on the structure of the network, biased TFP estimates can lead to under- or over-estimating network effects. I propose a modification of standard control function procedures that can flexibly account for a range of network effects and confounders. Using microdata from Compustat on buyer-supplier relationships between publicly-listed firms in the United States from 1976 to 1997, I find positive productivity spillovers from suppliers to customers, an effect that would be underestimated by standard methods.
